# **DDD template**

This repoitory follows Data Driven Design Strcuture.
In this structure, all the code is divided into four layers each being independent of each other.

- Application
- Domain
- Infrastructure
- Presentation

![alt text](ss/ddd.svg)

### Application

This layers contains all the business logic and stores all the blocs.
This layer is completely independednt of infrastructure layer and just contacts with Presentation and Domain Layer.

### Domain

This layer is in contact with Application and Infrastructure layer where we defines all the validation, model classes, abstract classes to be completed in infrastructure layer etc.

### Infrastructure

This layer contains all the backend related code that is related to API,
lets say if in future we wishes to move on AWS from firebase
then we need to touch only this layer.

### Presentation

This layer contains all the screen i.e. UI/UX part will be there and will remain in contact with application layer only.

## _File Strcucture_

### Outer Structure

```code

```

### Priciples followed:

- The presentation layer is the dumbest part of the app. Keep the logic to the minimum in this layer.

- Don't put string literals which are used to display on the app directly anywhere. Instead, reference it through the key from the localization file. This will make sure it's easy to add localization at a later stage without changing any code, just by updating the l10n file

- All the constants/configs which can change bw deployments (dev, staging, prod) should reside in the .env file. In a hypothetical scenario when the source code needs to be open sourced, no credentials should be compromised. [Further Reading](https://12factor.net/config)

- While integrating with any 3rd party libraries/services, there should not be tight coupling with their APIs. Instead, interfaces should be created for each service, so that at a later stage, they can be swapped out easily with other services by changing just the concrete implementation

- Try to follow the Arrange-Act-Assert or the Setup, Action, Result rule for writing tests

- Create barrel files as much as possible to reduce import statements [Extension to create barrel files](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miquelddg.dart-barrel-file-generator&ssr=false#overview)

- Add private constructor to classes which shouldn't be initialized and which only contains static variables/functions

## Git related guidelines

- structure of the git commit message: <type>(<scope>): <subject>
- <type> must be one of these:

  - build: Build related changes (eg: npm related/ adding external dependencies)
  - chore: A code change that external user won't see (eg: change to .gitignore file or .prettierrc file)
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation related changes
  - refactor: A code that neither fix bug nor adds a feature. (eg: You can use this when there is semantic changes like renaming a variable/ function name)
  - perf: A code that improves performance
  - style: A code that is related to styling
  - test: Adding new test or making changes to existing test
  - ci – continuous integration related
  - revert – reverts a previous commit
  - localize: translations related changes

- <scope> must be noun and it represents the section of the section of the codebase where changes are made. The <scope> can be empty (e.g. if the change is a global or difficult to assign to a single component), in which case the parentheses are omitted.
- <subject> is the message title
  - use imperative, present tense (eg: use "add" instead of "added" or "adds")
  - don't use dot(.) at end
  - don't capitalize first letter
- Sematic Versioning:
  - fix type commits should be translated to PATCH releases
  - feat type commits should be translated to MINOR releases
  - Commits with BREAKING CHANGE in the commits, regardless of type, should be translated to MAJOR releases.
